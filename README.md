# Mexico-Crime-dashboard
This dashboard is to visuallize how the crime is distributed in Mexico, so if anyone is interested in this field for a reason that person can see the crime distribution by states within his statistics in a resumed way or in general.
 
The dashboard is going to  be for download in this repositorie and also is going to be a jupyter notebook showing the primary transformations that where made in the data for his use in power BI.

## Important disclaimer
Not all the transformation were made whith pandas, I did those that consider like essentials for his use in Power BI, but then there was some important transformations made in power BI but that didn't realize when I were in Python. 

# Structure of the dashboard
I made the dashboard the most intuitive that I can, so that can be easy to use. 
## Window per crime
